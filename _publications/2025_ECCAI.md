As Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications increasingly migrate to the cloud, selecting appropriate deployment strategies that ensure performance while minimizing cost has become a key challenge. This paper investigates the deployment of a Computer Vision workload in four representative strategies across the edge–cloud continuum. These include cloud-only, edge-only, and hybrid edge-cloud architectures, incorporating both serverless and server-based computing models. Furthermore, we investigate the feasibility of integrating advanced techniques such as Split Computing and Early Exiting within hybrid architectures. We conduct real-world experiments throughout Germany on AWS cloud Availability Zones from Amazon and edge Wavelength Zones within Vodafone infrastructure. For each deployment strategy, we measure latency, accuracy, and operational cost. Our key findings reveal a 40% average lower end-to-end latency on edge deployments. We also outline the trade-offs and application scenarios for each strategy, providing practical guidance for the efficient deployment of computer vision systems in cloud/edge environments.
