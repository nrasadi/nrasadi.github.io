The Internet of Everything (IoE) remains fragmented by vendor-specific stacks, centralized bottlenecks, and the economic friction of transaction-fee-based blockchains. We present Versatile Network, a multi-layer, non-cryptocurrency blockchain architecture that separates high-volume peer-to-peer (P2P) data streams from global state validation. An intent-based communication model enables seamless interoperability among heterogeneous devices, while a resource-sharing framework lets constrained endpoints leverage network-wide compute and storage. Resource-based Sybil resistance and adaptive validation provide robust security without fees. Compared with Ethereum, Solana, and IPFS, Versatile Network achieves better suitability for IoE through cost-free operation, scalability, and seamless off-chain integration—positioning it as a pragmatic foundation for Web 4.0.
