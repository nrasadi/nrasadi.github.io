<p>Hello there!
<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44b.png" alt="" class="emoji" /> <br />
My name is Navidreza, though people usually call me “Navid” (<a href="https://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/navid">næˈviːd</a>). <br />
I am an MSc student at Computer Engineering department of the Sharif University of Technology (SUT), Iran.  <br />
Currently, I work as a research assistant at the <a href="http://easy.ce.sharif.edu">EASY Lab.</a> under supervision of <a href="http://sharif.edu/~goudarzi/">Professor Maziar Goudarzi</a>, where I collaborate on multiple academic and industrial projects related to my areas of expertise. <br />
I have participated in several projects during my studies, which have provided me with experience in these areas.</p>
