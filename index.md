{% capture aboutme %}

Hello there! 👋

My name is  Navidreza, but most people call me "Navid" \([næˈviːd](https://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/navid)\).   
I am a research and teaching assistant at the Computer Engineering Department at Technical University of Munich (TUM), working under the supervision of [Professor Wolfgang Kellerer](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lkn/team/staff/kellerer-wolfgang/).   
I collaborate on academic and industrial projects related to my areas of interests.

Before joining TUM, I was a research assistant at EASY Lab at Sharif University of Technology, where I received my MSc in Computer Engineering under the supervision of [Professor Maziar Goudarzi](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/maziargoudarzi).
