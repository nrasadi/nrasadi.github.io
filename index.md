Hello there!
<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44b.png" alt="" class="emoji" />   
My name is Navidreza, though people usually call me "Navid" \([næˈviːd](https://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/navid)\).   
I am a research assistant at the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Sharif University of Technology.
Currently, I work at the [EASY Lab.](http://easy.ce.sharif.edu) under the supervision of [Professor Maziar Goudarzi](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/maziargoudarzi), where I collaborate on multiple academic and industrial projects related to my areas of expertise.
