Hello there! üëã
<!-- <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44b.png" alt="" class="emoji" />    -->

My name is  Navidreza, though people usually call me "Navid" \([n√¶ÀàviÀêd](https://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/navid)\).   
I am a research and teaching assistant at the Computer Engineering Department at Technical University of Munich (TUM).   
I work at the [Chair of Communication Networks](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lkn/home/) under the supervision of [Professor Wolfgang Kellerer](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lkn/team/staff/kellerer-wolfgang/), where I collaborate on academic and industrial projects related to my areas of expertise.

Previously, I was a research assistant at EASY Lab at Sharif University of Technology, where I received my MSc in Computer Engineering under the supervision of [Professor Maziar Goudarzi](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/maziargoudarzi).
