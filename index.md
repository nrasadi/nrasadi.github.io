Hello there!
<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44b.png" alt="" class="emoji" />   
My name is Navidreza, though people usually call me "Navid" \([næˈviːd](https://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/navid)\).   
I am an MSc student at Computer Engineering department of the Sharif University of Technology (SUT), Iran.    
Currently, I work as a research assistant at the [EASY Lab.](http://easy.ce.sharif.edu) under supervision of [Professor Maziar Goudarzi](http://sharif.edu/~goudarzi/), where I collaborate on multiple academic and industrial projects related to my areas of expertise.   
I have participated in several projects during my studies, which have provided me with experience in these areas.
