This blog is a cozy corner dedicated to exploring and collecting researches, articles, and happenings around applied machine learning, systems and their intersection.   
It is an effort aiming at keeping myself updated with new findings, recent advances, and peaks and valleys in these domains.     
Occasionally delving into the depth, often shallower and broader, and mostly just pointers to papers, talks and posts; with zero guarantee on the correctness of the content.     

Feel free to leave comments, point out any mistakes (rest assured, there will be many), and share your own knowledge. Your contribution is greatly valued.
